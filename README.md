# Assembler-Simulation,  Faculty of Electrical Engineering, 2021

Application specification

A simple console application that represents a simulator of its own instruction set architecture with
at least 4 general-purpose registers of length 64 bits (it is allowed to use a data type of length 8 bytes, e.g. long
long or uint64_t for registers). The simulator should function as an interpreter. It should be possible to
source assembly code is loaded from a file. Correctly perform the necessary lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis
code. The instruction set of the simulated machine (guest) must include:
- basic arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV)
- basic bit logic operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- instruction for moving data between registers (MOV)
- an instruction to enter data from standard input (similar to the corresponding system call)
- an instruction to print data to standard output (similar to the corresponding system call)


Implement simple single-step debugging support. Enable execution and review of values
of all registers and specified memory addresses at set breakpoints in assembly language
code at runtime. In this mode, the transition to the next instruction (NEXT or STEP
console commands) and transition to the next breakpoint (CONTINUE).
